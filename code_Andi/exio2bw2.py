    adjusted: "Non-combustion"-emissions are now assigned to "fossil"-emissions (and not to "non-fossil" as suggested by
    Chris) to be consistent with the EXIOBASE-characterization factors. Also note that PFC- and HFC-emissions are assigned
    to fossil carbon dioxide since the PFC and HFC are already given in kgCO2-eq! THIS HAS TWO IMPLICATIONS: 1. PFC
    and HFC emissions are only considered for climate change issues; 2. PFC and HFC are not considered by EXIOBASE-
    characterization factors which should lead to higher results for subsequent computations with brightway2.
